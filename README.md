# detroit-mh-calls
 analysis of mental health call data from Detroit, September 2016 to August 2023

My intent is to explore whether the introduction of 988 in July 2022 has helped reduce the number of mental-health related calls. While I'm seeing a decline across all categories of mental health calls comparing the year before to the year after the introduction of 988, I'm not able to establish causation.

# Summary of Analysis
## overview of dataset
Data acquired via Detroit's Open Data Portal API between 9/20/16 and 8/25/23 (current date)
Filtered for 6 mental-health-related call types- MNTLPPRS, MNTLARM,MNTLNARM, WBC, SUICIP, SUICTHRT
Missing data for July 2017, September 2018, September-October 2019, September-October 2020, though data seems complete from January 2021 onwards

## summary of findings
Decrease across all 6 categories between year leading up to 988 (July 2021 to June 2022) and the year after (July 2022 to June 2023), though it's not possible to establish causation
Sharpest increase overall for WBC (Well Being Check) into 2021
Findings about seasonal differences are not valid, b/c of missing data

## possible next steps
Try to figure out why data are missing
look at 30-day data to see if there's anything on 988 referrals
